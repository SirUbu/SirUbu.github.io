            <p>I am a Gamer at heart. Gaming has been my number one hobby and interest since I was young. I started playing
                <a class="name" href="https://starcraft.com/en-us/">StarCraft</a>
                when I was less than 10 years old. Now, I play on every system known and all different types of games. The games I enjoy the most have been crafting survival games like 
                <a class="name" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/648800/Raft/">Raft</a>.
            </p>

            <br>

            <p>
                These types of games have hinted over the years to my skills and passion for being able to create and build things while using my problem solving skills to overcome obstacles. This is why I am learning coding and becoming a developer! Nothing is more enjoyable to me than being able to build and create the next technologies of our world. So that's a bit about me, please reach out to me to get to know me better!
