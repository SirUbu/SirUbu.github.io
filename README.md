# Responsive-Portfolio
This is my current portfolio page!

The "About Me" page is to have some biography about me to give you an idea of who I am,
whay I'm up to, and what I'm working towarads.

The "Contact" page is designed to allow you to send me a direct message. This will allow me to
communicate with anyone interested in speaking with me. This will be done via email.

The "Portfolio" page is meant to be a page to display all the different full stack development
items I've build as a developer.

Later, I would like to add a page dedicated to my streaming, broadcasting, pod casts, and other
streaming/media related items as Sir Ubu. I would also like my profile image on the index.html
to have a hover over secret link to this page.

I hope these pages well represent my accomplishments and abilities as a full stack developer.
I'm excited for this page to continue to grow and build!


Thanks,


- Sir Ubu
