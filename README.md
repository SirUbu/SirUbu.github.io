# Responsive-Portfolio
This is my current portfolio page!

## About Me
The "About Me" section is to have some biography about me to give you an idea of who I am, what I'm up to, and what I'm working towards.

## Projects
The "Projects" section is meant to be a page to display all the different full stack development projects I've worked on as a developer. These may be independent work, my certification class content lessons, or even group projects I've contributed to.

## Contact Me
The "Contact Me" section is designed to allow you to send me a direct message or link to my profiles in GitHub, LinkedIn, etc. This will allow me to communicate with anyone interested in speaking with me. Please reach out if you have advice for my development strategies, criticism or compliments, or would like to know me better (hint hint work/job/project/career opportunities!).

## More!

Later, I would like to add assets dedicated to my streaming, broadcasting, pod casts, and other streaming/media related items as Sir Ubu. My profile image on the index.html will have a hidden hover over link to this content.

## Summary

I hope these pages will represent my accomplishments and abilities as a full stack developer. I'm excited for this page to continue to grow and build as I continue to grow and learn in my development career! My true goal is to NEVER be complacent: I want to learn multiple languages so that I can build anything my heart desire and ultimately help build technology that improves every day life experience. 


Thanks,


- Sir Ubu
